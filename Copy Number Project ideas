Cancer biologists to ask if this is a good idea:

Which types of cancers are more heterogeneous?
Are there types of cancer that have 2-10 very distinct clones, each of which have largely homogenous genetic (copy number) profiles within?
When samples from a tumor are sequenced, how much of the tissue is actually sequenced?
How are samples from a tumor collected from patients for sequencing? Are these tumors that are removed by surgery entirely, or are they only biopsies of small parts of a tumor?
